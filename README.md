# FRE-GY 5040: Machine Learning for Finance with Python

This repository contains my assignments and coursework from the **FRE-GY 5040 Bootcamp - Machine Learning for Finance with Python** course. The course is designed to provide a hands-on understanding of machine learning techniques applied to financial data using Python.

## Course Topics
The course covers a range of topics, including:

1. **Pandas, Polars, and Numpy**
   - Focused on standard coding practices for data manipulation and analysis.

2. **Linear Regression Models**
   - Introduced machine learning applications for predicting continuous variables in finance.

3. **Linear Classification Models**
   - Covered techniques for predicting categorical variables.

4. **Time Series with Python**
   - Explored forecasting in time-series data.

5. **Preprocessing and Validation**
   - Focused on selecting the best model and preparing data for analysis.

6. **Non-Linear Regression**
   - Covered methods for predicting continuous values using non-linear approaches.

7. **Non-Linear Classification**
   - Techniques for classifying discrete values using non-linear models.

8. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Explored clustering and dimensionality reduction for data without labels.


## Key Learning Outcomes
- Developed skills in Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn.
- Applied machine learning techniques to real-world financial datasets.
- Built and validated models for regression, classification, and forecasting.
- Explored unsupervised learning methods for clustering and data understanding.

## About the Course
This course emphasizes practical implementation of machine learning algorithms in finance. The projects and assignments in this repository demonstrate my ability to:
- Clean and preprocess financial datasets.
- Build predictive models for stock prices, financial risks, and other financial metrics.
- Evaluate models using metrics like RÂ², RMSE, Precision, and Recall.
- Optimize workflows for handling large-scale financial datasets.
